So, you've been creating some incredible visuals with AI and are wondering if you can turn that creativity into cash. The good news is: you absolutely can. The bad news? The landscape for selling AI art in 2025 is a bit of a minefield, and a lot of the old advice is now flat-out wrong.

This guide cuts through the noise. We'll break down the two main paths you can take to sell your work and show you exactly which platforms fit into each, so you can choose the right strategy from the start.

## The Big Split: Open Marketplaces vs. Closed Ecosystems

The world of selling AI art has split into two very different models. Understanding this is the key to avoiding rejected images and wasted effort.

### Path 1: Open Marketplaces (Bring Your Own Art)

These are platforms that let you upload and sell art you've created with your own favorite tools, like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or our own powerful **[ArtigenV2](/artigenv2)**. They work like traditional stock photo sites but have updated their policies to include AI.

*   **Who are they?** **Adobe Stock** is the biggest player. Other great options include **Dreamstime**, **123RF**, and **Vecteezy**.
*   **The Upside:** Complete creative freedom. You can use any tool you like and sell the same artwork on multiple sites to maximize your reach.
*   **The Downside:** The legal responsibility is on you. You need to follow each site's strict labeling rules and ensure your work is commercially safe.

### Path 2: Closed Ecosystems (Use Our Tool)

These are industry giants that took a more cautious route. Worried about legal issues, they've banned externally generated AI art. Instead, they've built their own AI image generators.

*   **Who are they?** **Shutterstock** and **iStock (by Getty Images)** are the main players here.
*   **The Upside:** The images are generally considered "commercially safe" because they were trained on fully licensed content. This gives buyers (and you) peace of mind.
*   **The Downside:** You're locked into their system. You can *only* use their generator, and the art you create can *only* be sold on their platform. You can't sell your own art here; you can only make art for them.
