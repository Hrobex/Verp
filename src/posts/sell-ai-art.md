So, you've been creating incredible visuals with AI and are wondering if you can turn that creativity into cash. The good news is: you absolutely can. The bad news? The landscape for selling AI art in 2025 is more complicated than it looks, and misinformation can lead to a lot of wasted time and rejected images.

This guide cuts through the noise. We'll break down the two main paths you can take to sell your work and show you which platforms fit into each, so you can choose the right strategy for you.

## The Big Split: Open Marketplaces vs. Closed Ecosystems

The world of selling AI art has split into two distinct models. Understanding this difference is the key to getting your work accepted and sold.

### Path 1: Open Marketplaces (Bring Your Own Art)

These are the platforms that let you upload and sell art you've created with your own tools, like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or our own powerful **[ArtigenV2](/artigenv2)**. They function like traditional stock photo sites but have adapted to include AI.

*   **Who are they?** **Adobe Stock** is the biggest player here. Other great options include **Dreamstime** and **Vecteezy**.
*   **The Upside:** You have complete creative freedom. You can use any tool you like and sell the same artwork on multiple platforms to maximize your reach.
*   **The Downside:** The legal responsibility is on you. You must ensure your art doesn't infringe on any copyrights and follow each site's strict labeling and submission guidelines.

### Path 2: Closed Ecosystems (Use Our Tool)

These are industry giants that have taken a more cautious approach. Worried about the legal gray areas of AI, they've banned externally generated AI art. Instead, they've built their own AI image generators.

*   **Who are they?** **Shutterstock** and **iStock (by Getty Images)** are the main players in this category.
*   **The Upside:** The images you create with their tools are generally considered "commercially safe" because they were trained on fully licensed content. This gives buyers more confidence.
*   **The Downside:** You are completely locked into their system. You can only use their generator, and the art you create can only be sold on their platform.

## Which Path is Right for You?

Let's look at the key platforms to help you decide.

### Adobe Stock: The King of Open Marketplaces

If you want to sell the art you're already creating, this is your best starting point. Adobe's direct integration with its Creative Cloud apps gives you access to a massive market of designers and businesses. They offer a 33% royalty rate and are very clear about their submission rules.

These platforms do **not** accept your AI art. Instead, you use their built-in "Generative AI" tools to create content. While this limits your freedom, it offers a layer of legal protection and access to a premium customer base that trusts the platform's content. It's a different business model entirely—less about selling your art, and more about working for them.

### Dreamstime: A Solid Alternative

Dreamstime is another excellent open marketplace. It's a well-established site with a huge user base and offers a flexible revenue share (25-60%). It's a great platform to add to your distribution strategy alongside Adobe Stock.
