        <p className="mb-6 leading-loose">Simply put, there's a growing demand. Businesses, marketers, and individuals are tired of seeing the same generic stock photos everywhere. They're actively looking for unique, high-quality images that stand out. Your AI art can fill that need perfectly. And with tools like our own <SmartLink href="/artigenv2" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">ArtigenV2</SmartLink>, creating stunning pieces has never been easier.</p>
        
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Understanding the Market: Where to Sell</h3>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-loose">The stock photography world is dominated by a few big names, but their attitude towards AI art varies. Here's the breakdown:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 my-6 pl-4">
          <li><strong>The Big Leagues (AI-Friendly):</strong> <strong>Adobe Stock</strong> and <strong>Shutterstock</strong> are the two giants that have fully embraced AI-generated images, though they have strict rules.</li>
          <li><strong>The Holdouts:</strong> <strong>iStock (by Getty Images)</strong> maintains a strict policy against AI art from most generators.</li>
          <li><strong>The Great Alternatives:</strong> Platforms like <strong>Dreamstime</strong>, <strong>123RF</strong>, and <strong>Vecteezy</strong> are also welcoming to AI artists.</li>
